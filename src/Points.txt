OpenID 
	Superset of OAuth2 which add authentication

End Point:
	Authorization endpoint (IDP Level) -> redirection from client to IDP
	Token endpoint (IDP level) -> client request token (httpost)
	Rediction endpoint (client level) -> redirect too client
OpenID Flow
	Confidential Client : Web App
	Public Client : JS or Mobile App

Setup IdentityServer:
	When completed it will provide all the endpoints
	Setup users => scope = what can be accessed 
	Setup clients => scope = what can be accessed 

Setup in Client :
	Customize Authentication : need package openid connect
	OpenIDConnect is a middleware
	Client Restricted page 
		-> Redirect to IdentityServer 
		-> Logged In 
		-> IS calls redirect url (signin-oidc)
		-> Client Middleware calls token endpoint 
		-> IS return token 
		-> back to restricted page
